This repo is a work in progress and will serve as central place for code and datasets related to my research in the 2013 school year.
Four main areas I will be focusing on are:
* Using timed comment sentiment to generate a heatmap associated with a given SoundCloud track
* Clustering timed comments for intelligent previews
* Looking for trends in the BeatPort top charts
* Distribution of sentiment among remixes

All subtasks and goals are open to the public and can be viewed here:
