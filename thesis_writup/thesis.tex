\begin{abstract}
Electronic Dance Music (EDM) is a relatively new genre with unique features such as a myriad of sub genres and the common notion of playing live events in a festival format. With its rise to mainstream popularity, there are opportunities to explore the social dynamics of EDM by analyzing datasets associated with the genre. In our research, we seek to understand three such public datasets, the DJ Magazine Top 100, Electric Zoo Festival set lists, and SoundCloud comment data, at a deeper level. Some of the techniques employed are time-series analyses, network diagrams, and sentiment analysis, to help draw conclusions about this young, but rapidly growing, genre.
